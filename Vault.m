@implementation Vault
/*Add the vault scene in and mask the layer by making the screens zposition 2 while everything except the background is 3 and above. Make sure that the machine screen stretches long and far enough to hold all the fruits and veggies. Put the fruits in veggies on a seperate layer and add an action that states whenever the screen moves to the next position an skaction will run that will move the previous foods over, getting smaller as they go on and the new objects will move in and the middle on will get bigger while moving into place. In order to move the screen i will use the swipe left and swipe right gesture to move in to its next specified position which will be (+50x, 0y) <--- something like that.When the object is tapped the foods will fall like they do on main menu and there descriptions will fall in the players will be able to scroll down to read the full description. If the player clicks back it will drop the description and the foods will fall back down in the same position they were in when the player selected there food. f`1w2e34576*/
